### Issues

#### Open Issues

*None*

#### Closed Issues

> * SVCM1 - For the validate and translate concept map, is an additional
> actor needed? (that can be drawn from existing actors in other
> profiles) Simplified actors to “Terminology Repository” and
> “Terminology Consumer.”

> * SVCM2 - Use of the Clinical Mapping Profile (CMAP). Decision made to
> merge the updated FHIR-enabled SVS and CMAP Profiles into one here.

> * SVCM3 - Within the document, two words are being used for “value set.”
> One word “valuesets” is being used in the title to simplify and avoid
> the use of commas in the title.

> * SVCM4 - Older SVS language on the “Retrieve multiple value sets”
> transaction on intensional and extensional value set definitions was
> removed.

> * SVCM5 - Combine discovery use case for Code System, Value Set and
> Concept Map into one or separate out Concept Map discovery as its own
> use case?
>
>   * *Decided to keep these as one as the workflow is the same.*

> * SVCM6 - Confirm title for the merged SVS and updated CMAP Profiles –
> SVCM?
>
>   * *Title confirmed*

> * SVCM7 - Need decision on how/whether to incorporate Clinical Mapping
> (CMAP) Actor Options
>
>   * *Decided to not incorporate those options*

> * SVCM8 - Are there concepts or descriptions included in X.4 that are
> unnecessary for the purposes of this profile?
>
>   * *Removed most of this section to streamline it.*
